# SNHU CS-350 Portfolio
## Emerging System Arch. & Tech. Final Project
### Justin M. Smith

# Summary of Project and Problem Description
In this project, we were asked to create a prototype of a working thermostat with the following attributes,
* An initialized timer to drive specific actions
* An interrupt to detect button presses in the prototype board
* An I2C peripheral that can handle reading the temperature sensor
* A GPIO peripheral that can handle the output via LED's
* A UART2 peripheral that will be used to simulate the data output to the eventual server
* A task scheduler that handles the functionality implementation

The prototype board being used for this project is the Texas Instruments TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL

All code was composed within TI Code Composer Studio

- We were required to create functioning code to handle all of the above functionality and end up with a working prototype
- We were also required to provide a task scheduler diagram and a written report

# What did you do particularly well?
