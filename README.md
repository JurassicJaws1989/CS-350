# Summary of Project and Problem Description
In this project, we were asked to create a prototype of a working thermostat with the following attributes,
* An initialized timer to drive specific actions
* An interrupt to detect button presses in the prototype board
* An I2C peripheral that can handle reading the temperature sensor
* A GPIO peripheral that can handle the output via LED's
* A UART2 peripheral that will be used to simulate the data output to the eventual server
* A task scheduler that handles the functionality implementation
